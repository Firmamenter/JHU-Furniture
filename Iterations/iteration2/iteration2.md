## Part 3. Architecture

### System Architecture


We are planing to develop both the **Android Application System** and **Web management platform** based on Model-View-Controller(Presentor) pattern. 

![](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2016-group-16/blob/master/iteration2/image/Android.jpg)

####Deployment: 
Android devices + Server with public IP address(AWS)

####Client (View) : 

1. Include UI layout and reactful activities.
2. Send http request to server.
3. Receive http response and extract data out.

####Server(Model + Presentor) : 

1. Listen on 80 Port. Receive request and send response back.
2. Define the class methods and attributes.
3. Mapping database tables to model (logical classes).
4. manage database.

####Deployment: 

Server with Public IP Address(AWS). 

####Client (Browser) : 

1. Send http request to server.
2. Receive http response and extract data out.
3. Manage cookies and sessions.

####Server(View + Model + Presentor) : 

1. Include UI layout and reactful activities.
1. Listen on 80 Port. Receive request and send response back.
2. Define the class methods and attributes.
3. Mapping database tables to model (logical classes).
4. Manage database.

### Package Architecture
In order to maintain high cohesion and high modularity, the classes are grouped into packages by feature. Our second-hand funiture trading app has the following packages:

- com.JHUFurniture.user
- com.JHUFurniture.item
- com.JHUFurniture.loginRegister
- com.JHUFurniture.verification
- com.JHUFurniture.subscribe
- com.JHUFurniture.filterSearch
- com.JHUFurniture.recommendation
- com.JHUFurniture.googleMap
- com.JHUFurniture.facebook

Each package contains all items related to the feature, from user-interface, to Java code, to database items. The details of each package  is as below:

- com.JHUFurniture.user
  * UI pages related to basic user activity like editing user information, displaying user's wishlist, selling list, and etc.
  * User.java - a Model object
  * SellingList.java - a Model object
  * Wishlist.java - a Model object
  * UserController.java - a controller object
  * UserService.java - a service object
  * database items (User, SellingList, Wishlist)
  
 
- com.JHUFurniture.item
  * UI pages related to posting a new item, displaying item information, and etc.
  * Item.java - a Model object
  * ItemController.java - a controller object
  * ItemService.java - a service object
  * database items (Item)
  

- com.JHUFurniture.signin
  * UI pages related to log in, log out
  * SigninRegisterController.java - a controller object
  * SigninRegisterService.java - a service object
  
  
- com.JHUFurniture.Register (use JavaMail, Nexmo/DIY-2FA)
  * UI pages related to registration
  * RegisterController.java 
  * RegisterService.java

- com.JHUFurniture.subscribe (use JavaMail)
  * UI pages related to customize a subscription request
  * Subscribe.java - a Model object
  * SubscribeController.java
  * SubscribeService.java
  * database items (Subscribe)
  * mail.HTML -  HTML framework of the email
   
- com.JHUFurniture.filterSearch
  * UI pages that allows user to select of set of checkboxes and then displays a list of items
  * filterController.java
  * filterService.java

- com.JHUFurniture.recommendation (use machine learning package: Weka)
  * precomputation.java - precompute a table of variables, which will be used by our recommendation alogrithm very  frequently, to avoid wasteful duplication of effort.
  * recommendation.java - contain recommendation algorithms  
<font color="#a50e0e" size = "px"> recommendation system only changes the order we display items. It uses the same UI and DB as them in item package.</font>

- com.JHUFurniture.googleMap (use GoogleMap and MapFragment)
  * UI pages used to integrate google maps in our application in order to show item location on the map, and to calculate the distance between item's location and user's home address
  * mapController.java
  * mapService.java
 
- com.JHUFurniture.facebook (use Facebook4J library)
  * UI page that redirects user to the seller's facebook page

In summary, we decide to use sparkJava as the Java web framework, MySQL for the database in our andriod app. Helper libraries includes 

- Google Gson (JSON)
- JavaMail (email verification and subscription)
- Nexmo/DIY-2FA (phone number verification)
- Google maps (calculate distance between item and user)
- Facebook API
- Weka (recommendation system)

## Part 5 JavaDoc 
see attached document: javaDoc
## Part 6. UML class diagram 

![](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2016-group-16/blob/master/iteration2/image/UML.png)

##7. Prototyping code##
###Insturctions###
The android project folder is named "View" and is located at "iteration2/View". Please import the folder into Android Studio and test it.

###Summary###
We have finished a prototype of the registration part in Android Studio. The first page is the email verification page, user can enter his/her email address and then click the "verify" button. Since we have not implemented the actual email verification feature, the page for successful verification will be loaded no matter what the user has entered. After 3 sceonds, the page for phone verification will show up. The phone verification page works similarly to the email verification page. After phone verification, user will be directed to the password setup page. Finally, a "done" page will show up, indicating the registration process is finished. 

###Accomplishment###
1. We have figured out how to navigate from one page to another and how to load a new page with a time counter.
2. We have coded our frontend so it closely (though not exactly)  resembles our UI sketches.

###Goals###
1. We need to implement the email and phone verification features.
2. We need to add a login button on the action bar.
